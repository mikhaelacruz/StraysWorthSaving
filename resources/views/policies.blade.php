                        <p class="card-text">Assess the Situation: Observe the stray from a safe distance to determine if it’s approachable and healthy. Look for signs of injury, illness, or aggression.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Prepare Your Home: Ensure you have the necessary supplies, such as food, water, a bed, and a safe space. Familiarize yourself with local animal shelters and veterinarians for support.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">Approach Safely: Use calm, gentle movements to avoid startling the stray. Offer food to build trust, and if necessary, use a humane trap if the animal is too fearful or difficult to catch.</p>

                        <p>Capture Carefully: Once you have the stray in a secure location, use a leash or carrier to transport them safely. Avoid direct contact until you’ve assessed their health and behavior.</p>

                        <p>Rehabilitate and Socialize: Provide a comfortable environment and gradually introduce the stray to your home. Socialize them with gentle interactions and monitor their behavior as they adjust to their new surroundings.</p>
